Despite potential drawbacks like the possibility of narcissistic behavior, it offers a practical and fulfilling approach to finding life's meaning through personal development.\n",

       "3. **Social Connection and Contribution (8/10):** This solution highlights the importance of empathy, compassion, understanding of others, and contributing to society's betterment. It fosters a sense of belonging and purpose, balancing individual needs with societal engagement, despite potential challenges in navigating social dynamics.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Existentialism's Embrace (7/10):** Existentialism acknowledges the absurdity of existence while encouraging individuals to create their own purpose. It promotes authenticity and self-discovery, though it may lead to nihilism and a lack of practical guidance for life's challenges.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Spiritual Perspectives (6/10):** Offering a sense of purpose and connection to something greater, spiritual perspectives encourage self-reflection and growth. However, they may conflict with scientific views and can be challenging to define objectively, leading to a lower ranking.\n",
